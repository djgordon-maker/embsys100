Using the 2s compliment to descirbe negative numbers helps avoid confusion and maximize data usefulness.

The most obvious alternitive is to use the sign bit to determine positive or negative and interpret the rest as normal.
That method allows a "negative 0" value which can cause confusion.  Using the 2s compliment allows the negative 0 to have a unique value, which is simply more useful.
