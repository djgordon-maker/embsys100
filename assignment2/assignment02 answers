1. Inject 0x1FFFFFFF and add one
a) Local value is 536870912
b) Register value is 0x20000000
c) APSR has no flags set. Its a positive, non zero number, and the last action did not cause an overflow or a carry bit

2. Inject 0xFFFFFFFF and add one
a) Local value is 0
b) APSR 'C' and 'Z' flags are set.  The last add one resulted in a carry bit and returned zero


3. Inject 0x1FFFFFFF in an unsigned variable and add one
a) Local value is 536870912
b) APSR has no flags set. Its a positive, non zero number, and the last action did not cause an overflow or a carry bit

4. Inject 0x1FFFFFFF in an unsigned variable and add one
a) Local value is 0
b) APSR 'C' and 'Z' flags are set.  The last add one resulted in a carry bit and returned zero

5. Move counter to top of file
a) counter is global
b) It is not visible in the Local view
c) Track counter in the Watch view
d) 0x20000000

6. Run new program
a) The value of counter is 4
b) This first line of main() assigns the address of counter to p_int.  The next three lines add one to the value stored at the address stored in p_int, infact adding one to counter.

7. Run same program on board
a) Counter is stored at 0x20000000
b) Counter is stored in RAM
c) At the end of the program Counter's value is 4
